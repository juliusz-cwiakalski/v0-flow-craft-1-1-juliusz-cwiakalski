# Product Discovery Process for FlowCraft

This directory contains the complete product discovery process for FlowCraft, focusing on the strategic objective of reducing customer churn for teams scaling to 30-50 employees. The documents follow a structured approach, from raw user feedback analysis to prioritized, actionable product experiments.

## The Discovery Workflow

The process is designed to ensure that all development work is directly traceable to validated user needs and strategic business goals. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Problem Identification**: The process begins with analyzing raw user feedback from competitor platforms to identify common pain points. This raw data is summarized in `pain-points-summaries.md`.
2.  **Pain Point Synthesis**: The raw feedback is synthesized into five core problem areas that directly contribute to customer churn. This analysis provides the "why" behind our strategic focus.
3.  **Opportunity Mapping (OST)**: The identified pain points are used to build an Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). This framework helps map user needs (Opportunities) to potential features (Solutions) that address our main objective.
4.  **Prioritization (MoSCoW & RICE)**: Potential solutions from the OST are rigorously prioritized using MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) and RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) scoring. This ensures we focus on the highest-impact initiatives first.
5.  **Experiment Definition**: The top-ranked solutions are defined as concrete, minimal product experiments designed for rapid implementation and validation within the V0 prototype.

## Key Artifacts

Each file in this directory represents a critical step in the discovery process. For a complete understanding, it is recommended to read them in the following order:

1.  **[Raw User Feedback Summaries](./pain-points-summaries.md)**
    - Contains summaries of user posts from platforms like Jira, ClickUp, and Monday.com, detailing their frustrations and needs. This is the foundational raw data for our analysis.

2.  **[Pain Points Analysis](./pain-points-analysis-notebookml.md)**
    - A deep-dive analysis that synthesizes thousands of data points into the 5 most critical pain points driving churn. This document establishes the core problems FlowCraft aims to solve.

3.  **[Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)](./ost-notebooklm.md)**
    - A detailed breakdown of the strategic objective (reducing churn) into distinct user opportunities and potential solutions.
    - See also: **[OST Mermaid Diagram](./ost-diagram.md)** for a visual representation.

4.  **[Roadmap & Prioritization](./roadmap-notebooklm.md)**
    - A MoSCoW and RICE analysis of all potential solutions identified in the OST. This document provides a data-driven, ranked list of features that forms our product roadmap.

5.  **[Product Experiments](./product-experiments.md)**
    - Defines the first three high-priority experiments derived from the roadmap. This document outlines the scope and deliverables for the initial V0 prototype, creating a "Golden Thread" from problem to solution.
