| 2285 | clickup | A two-person bookkeeping firm relied on a ClickUp email-to-task extension which failed for a week, breaking client-folder workflows and creating a backlog; ClickUp fixed it, and the firm is seeking alternatives and backups. | [{"problem":"Email-to-task integration failure halted core workflows and task creation.","category":"Integration / Automation","root_cause":"Single integration dependency (browser extension) introduced a single point of failure."},{"problem":"Vendor silence and slow incident communication amplified business impact during outage.","category":"Reliability / Bugs / Stability","root_cause":"Insufficient support/incident transparency from the vendor."},{"problem":"Workflows lack redundancy or fallback capture, causing backlog during peak periods.","category":"Workflow / Process","root_cause":"No secondary capture channel or automated backup process for incoming client work."},{"problem":"Underutilized platform features paired with heavy reliance on one integration hinder resilience.","category":"Migration / Adoption / Onboarding","root_cause":"Teams optimized around one convenience feature instead of diversified workflows."},{"problem":"Week-long outage created operational overload and reduced productivity during a monthly peak.","category":"Productivity / Focus","root_cause":"Outage timing plus lack of contingency planning caused severe backlog."}] | ["Build robust email-to-task native integration with attachment handling.","Provide offline/catch-all fallbacks (email-inbox to queue) for outages.","Offer incident SLA and proactive outage notifications for paid tiers.","Provide client-folder templates and import/export tools for quick migration.","Add automated backups and retry logic for extension-driven captures."] | 84 | Directly highlights email integration reliability, fallback capture, and vendor support—key gaps that block adoption and retention for small teams relying on lightweight PM tools. |
| 2288 | clickup | User reports major failures and data-loss when importing ~60 Asana projects into ClickUp; native importer stalls, is slow, flattens nested subtasks, and hits task limits; third-party Altosio solved it. | [{"problem":"Native import tool stalls or fails, leaving migrations incomplete.","category":"Migration / Adoption / Onboarding","root_cause":"Fragile importer lacking resumable job orchestration and robust error handling."},{"problem":"Import throughput is extremely slow and requires many manual import jobs.","category":"Integration / Automation","root_cause":"No batch orchestration, parallelization, or bulk-job management."},{"problem":"Nested subtasks are flattened, losing original task hierarchy and context.","category":"Migration / Adoption / Onboarding","root_cause":"Importer fails to map multi-level subtask models between platforms."},{"problem":"Platform/task-count limits blocked migration of large task trees (≈1000+ tasks).","category":"Scalability / Performance","root_cause":"Undocumented/unsupported size limits and no graceful migration strategy."},{"problem":"Poor visibility into import progress and failure reasons during migration.","category":"Reporting / Visibility / Analytics","root_cause":"Lack of preflight checks, detailed logs, and actionable error reporting."}] | ["Provide resumable, monitored import jobs with pause/retry and parallelism.","Preserve multi-level nested subtasks with configurable mapping rules.","Add preflight migration checks that surface limits and risks.","Expose detailed per-project import logs and actionable error guidance.","Offer migration concierge or vetted partner integrations (third-party services)."] | 86 | Import reliability, nested-task fidelity, and migration visibility directly affect onboarding and retention for teams moving between PM tools—core FlowCraft concerns. |
